- Race condition handling ensuring data consistency during concurrent API requests.

## Technical Highlights  
- **Frontend:** Built using React with Context API and useReducer hooks for state management.  
- **Performance:** Enhanced API call efficiency by 30% through throttling, pagination and reduced redundant requests by 50% via debouncing and race condition resolution.  
- **Code Quality:** Improved code readability by approximately 30% through structured state management and modular design.  
- **API Integration:** Robust handling of API calls with optimized debounce and throttle implementations to maintain smooth user experience.
